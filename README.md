# dotfiles
These are my personal dotfiles and my attempt at getting more organized.

# Installation
## Manual Installation
Until I get a better method for installing these files, it will largely be:
```bash
ln -s ~/Documents/src/<file> ~/.<file>
```
## Required Packages
These are my typical apt packages to get up and running:
```bash
sudo apt install byobu vim build-essential htop python3-pip
```
